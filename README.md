# aes_algorithm_implementation
The python implementation of AES compares the advantage of using Numba and Numpy libraries vs not using any.
Parallel Algorithm: Uses Numba library for parallelizing and vectorizing the functions and uses Numpy to handle the data efficiently.
Serial   Algorithm: Does not use any library and runs in a serial order.
